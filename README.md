In this program, I have created is a fairly simple game where the user has to guess a number within a limited number of attempts.

# What I have done:

- Created a new project in Visual Studio and Name the project "NumbersGame".
- The program starts with a welcome message.
- The program generates a number (between 1 and 20) for the user to guess
- The user will enter a number to guess
- If the number is guessed wrong, the program will respond with either "Sorry, you guessed too low!" or "Sorry, you guessed too high!" on the basis of the user's guess.
- If the user guesses correctly, the program will print "Woho! You did it!"
- If the user unable to guess in five (5) tries, the program will reply "Sorry, you failed to guess the number in five tries!" and will also ask user to exit.
- A separate function/method, named `CheckGuess()` , has been created to do the whole check.
